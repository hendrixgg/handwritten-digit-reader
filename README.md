Using a deep neural network to recognize handwritten digits

The images are from here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

### 16_16_Network.bin results:  [average cost: 0.067505] [8.63% test error rate]
### 50_50_Network.bin results:  [average cost: 0.062237] [7.81% test error rate]
### 300_150Network.bin results: [average cost: 0.046820] [5.68 % test error rate]

The next step would be to figure out how to make this work with a convolutional neural network
