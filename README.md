using a deep neural network to recognize handwritten digits

the images from here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

currently there is no training implemented so the results are random

16_16_Network.bin results: [average cost: 0.067505] and [8.63% test error rate]
50_50_Network.bin results: [average cost: 0.062237] [7.81% test error rate]
300_150Network.bin results: [average cost: 0.046820] [5.68 % test error rate]
